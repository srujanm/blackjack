# blackjack
This is a text-based single player blackjack game that runs on the command line. It was created as a python learning assignment and was developed and tested on python 3.6 installed on Windows 10. Python was installed via the corresponding Miniconda distribution but this package itself does not require anything outside in-built python packages.

You can download the package by cloning this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/srujanm/blackjack.git
```

Once downloaded, you can run the game from the command line as
```
python -m blackjack
```
