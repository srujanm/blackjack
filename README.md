# blackjack
This is a text-based single player [blackjack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack) game that runs on the command line. It was created as a python learning assignment and is a simplified game since some of the original rules of blackjack are eliminated. If you are just getting started with python or are new to object-oriented programming, adding some new features in the source code to make the game more realistic is a great learning experience.

blackjack was developed and tested on python 3.6 installed on Windows 10. Python was installed via the corresponding [Miniconda](https://conda.io/miniconda.html) distribution but this package itself does not require anything outside in-built python packages.

## Installation

You can download the package by cloning this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/srujanm/blackjack.git
```

Once downloaded, you can run the game from the command line as
```
python -m blackjack
```
## Further development

If you are interested in looking at the source code with a magnifying glass or developing it further, the Jupyter notebooks in the [blackjack-dev](https://github.com/srujanm/blackjack-dev) repo are a great starting point.
